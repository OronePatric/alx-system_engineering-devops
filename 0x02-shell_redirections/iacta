To get something you have never had you got to do something you never did.
Come unto me all you that labour and heavy laden and I will give you rest for your souls.
Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, For I am meek and lowly in heart and you will find rest for your souls.
Blessed is the man whom the Lord shall teach out His Law.
For he shall have rest.
For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
